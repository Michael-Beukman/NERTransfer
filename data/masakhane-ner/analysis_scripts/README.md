# Masakhane Analysis Scripts

This directory contains some scripts to run [interpretable evaluation](https://github.com/neulab/InterpretEval) on the Masakhane data.

Check out `run_all_analyses.sh` to get started.

When it is done running, you should have analysis reports included in `InterpretEval/interpretEval/analysis/tEval-ner-masakhane-*.html`
