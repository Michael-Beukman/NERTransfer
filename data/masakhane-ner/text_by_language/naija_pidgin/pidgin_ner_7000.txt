Even as im dey handle e own injuries, and fear, Obilale bin dey able to remember and tok wetin happun dat day.
Im remember as assistant coach Amelete Abalo shout say dem don shoot am - di 54-year-na one of di pipo wey die for di attack.
E remember one team-mate wey get military training call for weapon, so dat e go fit fight back.
Di team bin no dey able to escape from di shooting because di bus driver - Mario Adjoua - don also wunjure for di start of di attack.
Di convoy by-force stop, and serious firefight brake out between di attackers and di security forces.
Memories of how long e last dey different, but everyone agree say na at least 30 minutes e last.
Adebayor tok about how serious di longest half hour of e life dey.
"No be like say one or two guys shoot one or two times on our bus," Adebayor tell me afta im don dey safe place for di team hotel few hours afta di attack.
"We don dey di middle of dat for 30 minutes or even more.
Our bus bin don stop and pipo bin don dey shoot our bus for 30 minutes.
Can you imagine?
Honestly na one of di worst experiences I don eva get for my life.
"Without di security den I no go dey here dey tok you.
Maybe na my dead body you fit dey tok to."
Accounts of how e all end different - Adebayor describe one fleet of 4x4 vehicles arrive to take di squad away even as dem still dey shoot from di forest, while Senaya remember silence.
But eventually dem take all of dem to hospital for di outskirts of Cabinda City, wia those wey noting do help carry dia dead and colleagues wey wunjure inside.
"Those na di times wey you realise wetin dey happun really, wen I take one of di players inside di hospital," Adebayor tok.
"Wen I come out, I see all di players, and everyone bin dey cry, everyone bin dey tok about dia family, calling pipo, calling dia mama, dey cry for phone.
"I think dat na di worst moment of dis day, because you fit see pipo tell dia last words, because dem think say dem go die."
Shortly afta dat di squad security men leave di squad on dia own wit few local officials.
Wit dead and injured friends and colleagues for hospital, dem later walk short distance to dia hotel compound, without any security whatsoever.
Dat na wia I come across dem, and I walk wit di team as dem waka go back dia accommodation.
All four teams for di group bin dey stay for di same compound and Kolo Toure and couple of oda Ivorians come to offer condolences and find out wetin happen - rumours bin done already spread.
Di survivors den sidon to eat - e bin dey late for evening, by dis point dem neva chop anytin since.
Throughout di meal, evriwia bin dey silent.
Di news of di attack make global headlines, and wia 24 hours earlier I bin dey able to walk in simply wit tournament accreditation, di next day heavy paramilitary security surround di hotel complex.
Officials, goment ministers and representatives of di Confederation of African Football fly in from Angola capital Luanda, wit questions about wetin happen, who dey responsible, and why - for sometin wey go against tournament rules - Togo decide to drive instead of fly.
Shortly afta di attack claim of responsibility comot from di Front for di Liberation of di Enclave of Cabinda, wey be separatist group wey never don accept di decision of di former colonial power, Portugal, to integrate Cabinda into Angola in di late 1950s.
Several factions of di body bin dey, and which one dey responsible no dey clear - but e clear from very early on say dis no be attempted robbery.
Anoda question lie for di presence Angolan security wey travel with di team.
If Togo no dey authorised to drive to Cabinda, why and how come dem even get escort?
And na di militarised escort cause di attack?
None of dis questions get clear answers, even 10 years on - and at di time di most immediate issue for di players na to absorb wetin don happen to dem and decide wetin to do next.
For several days e no dey clear to those of us wey watch from di outside wetin go happen.
Rumours suggest say split bin dey between those for camp wey want continue wit di tournament and those wey want go home.
In di end, Togolese authorities for Lome take decision, dem call di squad home to attend di funeral of those wey die and take part in ceremonies of national mourning - decision wey later make Caf ban dem sake of alleged "government interference" for football.
Few days afta dia terrifying experience, Togo Sparrowhawks come out of dia hotel complex for anoda heavily armed convoy, dis time dem head towards Cabinda airport, and later leave.
But di consequences of wetin happen no go easily leave di mind of those wey involve for di assault.
Two pipo bin die and a number of odas seriously wound - di worst na di goalkeeper, Obilale.
Initially tori spread say im die too.
Dat no dey true, but e suffer serious damage to im spine, intestines, liver and bladder, and dem transfer am go hospital for South Africa, to begin e recovery.
Since den e don face eight major operations and don get to rebuild e life, physically and emotionally.
"I done do lot of tins, and I happy say I do dem.
I go back to school, take exams, work and write book," im tok.
For long time im work wit children with special needs, as e help dem through di medium of football, and e don set up e own organisation to continue dat work.
Obilale lose e livelihood - and almost e life - for Cabinda and e dey striking say im tok say na since only di change in leadership for di Confederation of African Football for 2017, wen current president Ahmad comot Issa Hayatou, na im e don get any meaningful contact wit di continental governing body.
On Tuesday night Caf give am special award, 10 years from Cabinda, to recognise e achievement for im recovery, and wetin e dey do to help odas.
Cameroon legend Samuel Eto'o na di host for Hurghada, and e be one of several former players wey don provide steady support.
Odas na e former captain Adebayor and Ghana Ayew brothers - Andre Ayew and e brother Rahim bin dey part of di Black Stars squad wey play for Cabinda for 2010.
Even those wey e no affect physically face significant challenges for di wake of di attack.
Junior Senaya, wey be player wey help take Togo to dia remarkable first World Cup for Germany for 2006, bin dey only 25 wen e happen, but e football career end dat day.
"E bin dey psychologically catastrophic, e turn [tins] upside down," na so im tok.
"I really no fit recover...
I find no reason at all to play football for my club because psychologically I bin dey shocked."
Now im dey study for e coaching badges.
E last for half an hour, maybe a little more.
Why and how e happen na still di subject of some dispute.
But no one fit deny di human cost of dat short bus trip for Cabinda, 10 years ago.

Dis report don cause debate for social media as pipo dey react to di tori.
Jeff Bezos na di founder and CEO of e-commerce company Amazon, im be di owner of di Washington Post company and founder of di space exploration company Blue Origin.
Im successful business dem don make am one of di richest pipo for di world, with $145 billion dollars as im net worth as at 2020.

Im parent give am $300,000 to invest for di company.
Bezos bin warn pipo wey invest for di business say 70% chance dey say di business fit fail.
For 1998, di site expand to offer music, videos, and other consumer goods, and for 2002, Bezos launch Amazon Web Services, wey dey compile data from weather channels and website traffic.
From Washington post to Whole Foods, Bezoz get plenti company under im Amazon group of companies.

During di same period, wey over 22 million Americans file for unemployment.
Di Amazon CEO and entrepreneur, Jeff Bezos, don grow im fortune by $24bn and dis na 20% increase within four months.

Di increase in demand of pipo wey dey do online shopping ontop Amazon sake of coronavirus lockdown make im shares to go up.

"Dem tok.
Kim Jong-un don appear for public for di first time in 20 days, North Korean state tori pipo tok.
KCNA news agency reports say di North Korean leader cut di ribbon for di opening of a fertiliser factory.
Dem add say pipo for di factory"break into clap dey shout hurrah" wen he appear on Friday.
Di reported appearance - na im first since one event on state media on 12 April - and dis dey come as tori bin dey fly upandan say Oga Kim don die.
We never fit independently confam dis latest tori wey North Korean media dey report.
State media later release picture wey show Oga Kim dey cut ribbon outside one factory.
When dem ask America President Donald Trump about di reappearance of Oga Kim, he tok say im no wan comment.
Coronavirus don spread go more than 80 kontris and thousands of new cases na im dem dey report for across di world evri day.
For now, no vaccine dey wey fit protect pipo against dis disease.
But wen dat one go change?
Researchers dey develop vaccines and dem don begin dey test am for animal body, if e go well, dem go begin dey test am for pipo body too later.
But even if scientists fit jolly say dem find vaccine before Christmas, work still dey of how dem go fit produce am make e plenti.
Dis one mean say, e dey possible make vaccine no ready at least till di middle of next year.
All of dis tins just dey happun for different level and to use new approaches to vaccines, guarantee no dey say everything go jell like dat.
Remember say na four coronaviruses dey waka for inside human beings.
Na dem dey cause di common cold and vaccine neva dey for any of dem.
E fit no dey successful for pipo wey dey old sake of dia immune system.
Immunization no dey too work for pipo wey don old.
Dis dey happun every year wen one flu come out and e affect dem.
All melecines, even Paracetamol dey get side effect.
But if dem no do clinical experiments, e dey impossible to know wetin go be di side effect of experimental vaccine.
Vaccines dey prevent infections and di best way to do dat for now na to get correct hygiene.
If you dey infected by coronavirus, for most pipo, e no dey too serious.
Some anti-viral drugs wey dem use for clinical trials dey, but we no dey too sure if any of dem dey work.
Vaccines dey harmlessly show viruses or bacteria (or even small parts of dem) wey dey di immune system.
Di bodi defences sabi dem as intruder, come learn how to fight am.
If di bodi come dey exposed to virus, e don already sabi how to fight di infection.
For tens of years, di main method of vaccination na to use di original virus.
Di measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine wey dey na from di weakened versions of those viruses wey no fit cause full-blown infection dem use.
Di seasonal catarrh and cough wey always dey catch pipo for some kain period, di vaccine, dem make di vaccine from di main strains of flu doing di rounds and dem disable dem patapata.
Di work for new coronavirus special treatment injection alias vaccine go use newer, and less tested, approaches called "plug and play" vaccines.
Becos we know di genetic code of di new coronavirus, Sars-CoV-2, we now don get di complete blueprint to carry build that virus.
Some vaccine scientists dey carry small sections of di coronavirus genetic code and dey put am into oda viruses wey dey completely harmless.
Now you fit "infect" persin wit di harmless bug and in theory give some immunity against infection.
Other groups dey use pieces of raw genetic code (either DNA or RNA depending on the approach) which, once dem inject am inside di body, e go begin produce bits of viral proteins which di immune system again fit learn to fight.
Big-big politicians dem for northern Nigeria want make dem stop di Koranic  schools dem afta some pikin hide dem sef for di middle of di coronavirus outbreak for di kintri according to BBC tori pipo.
Dis na as dem don pack tens of thousands of Koranic school pikin for open van like sardine dey go back house for move wey many pipo dey say no make sense but wey state goments dey use to prevent corononavirus from dia states.
Right now, ban dey for inter state travel but di vans dey allowed to carri pikin waka from state to state to carry di boys go house wherever e dey.
E be like na di biggest mass movement of pikin dem for Nigeria wey dia population of 200 million dey divided almost equally between Muslims and Christians.
Nobodi know how many of dis pikin dem, wey Hausa dey call almajirai (almajiri for one pesin) wey come rom di Arabic word al-Muhajirun wey mean emigrant, don go house but Kaduna say dem don send reach 30,000 go back house.
But no bodi bin sabi say some of di pikin dey cari coronavirus for bodi and na so officials contribute to share di virus like na palliative.
As di pikin dem land for dia home state dem cari some of dem put for quarantine and test dem, 65 positive cases for Kaduna state and 91 for Jigawa state.
For Gombe dem record eight positive cases and for Bauchi na seven.
Ds na as dem still dey wait for hundreds of test results and never even test thousands more.
But di head of di Nigerian presidential task force for Covid-19 Boss Mustapha bin wanrn say dis kain waka go cccause wahala but northern govnors no listen.
Dem see di pandemic as opportunity to scrap almajiri Koranic schools wey don dey as Islamic education for di mostly Muslim north.
Even sef Kaduna state govnor, Nasir el-Rufai say, "we don dey find wetin to use end dis system because e no dey work for di pikin dem, northern Nigeria or Nigeria sef."
E say e beta to give almajiria modern education so dem no go waste dia lives dey beg for road.
Almajirai na mostly pikin wey come from poor homes and go stay for boarding house type place for five to ten years dey memorize Koran with teacher wey dem dey call mallam.
About 10.5 million Nigerian children aged between five and 14 years are not in school, according to the UN children's agency, Unicef.
Unicef no dey consider almajirai as pikin dem wey dey go school so dem make up a large part - if not di majority - of dis number.
Dis schools dem dey admit pikin wey dey as young as five, and dem suppose give di teachers 100 naira evri Wednesday wey be end of week.
Di mallams say di money dey maintain di school and dem no dey chop di money.
But di pikin dem no fit find di money from anywia wey dey make dem enta road to beg or menial work to see di money.
Di mallams sef no get money, no dey regulated or get any tainingg.
Ans most dey do farming wey di almajirai dey join hand without pay.
Islamic teachings on hygiene: Di schools dem close for March wen state goments shut down places of learning and na dem state goments use fear of spreading di virus start di process to send di almajirai go house, afta dem start to dey beg for street again.
But e happun too late, No one sabi how di pikin dem get di virus but former almajiri, Imrana Mohammed say na from di beggars wey dem meet as dem bin dey meet wen dem dey beg.
Oga Mohammed wey dey run small petroleum business say wen e be almajiri 14 years ago, e bin dey do house boy work for $6 dollars per month and for food to chop.
Tok-tok don dey to end di system but e dey very sensitive inside region wia religion na extremely sensitive issue,  Pipo wey dey support di schools accuse those wey want to reform am of attempting to stop Islamic education.
Former presido Goodluck Jonathan bin sink billions of Nigeria for almajiri schools for north wey go combine Islamic and circular education.
But Muhammadu Buhari, don say make dem ban almajiri system give di schools dem to state goments and Islamic scholars make dem manage dem.
Some parents, like Shafiu Yau, no want make dem scrap di system "because na way to heaven".
E tell BBC say im 15 year old son be almajiri for Kano State for im second year as no be evri pesin dem pursue go house and e dey hope say afta five years di boy go come back with Koran knowledge but no be evri pesin dey tink like am.
Sheikh Abdullahi Garangamawa, wey be chief imam for Jafar Adam Mosque for northern Nigeria main city Kano, tell BBC say dem don abuse di almajiri system.
"Di almajiri as e dey now na slavery and goment need to act fact.
"Instead of di boys to dey learn Islamic knowledge, na criminals and jaguda for politicians be dia work now."
Dis na harsh take on almajiri for northern Nigeria but e no go end until di goment tackle poverty and give di pikin and dia parents beta life.
As di worst of coronavirus be like say e don pass for many kontris, goment dey reduce rules dem put to reduce di spread of di virus.
E no go be like di life wey we sabi but at least di public and businesses dem go fit relax from weeks of lockdown.
Di way coronavirus don affect plenti kontris dey different so na different ways dem dey comot lockdown but most of di wahala wey dey in front dey similar and na wetin we dey look.
Scientists don warn say if authorities too rush with di way dem call of dia lockdown measures, e fit lead to second wave of coronavirus infections even as cases and deaths don dey reduce.
Pushan Dutt, professor of Economics at Insead Business School say make kontris use Singapore take do example as dem dey reduce lockdown.
Singapore begin see spike for dia numbers afta dem drop di measures dem bin put when dem become one of di most affected kontri afta China for February.
In just 3 days dem see 3,000 new cases for April and come put back di lockdown to 1 June.
Japan sef bin get second wave for di north of di kontri for Haikkaido city.
Di number of new cases bin don go down to zero but by 17 March need dey for second lockdown na why e dey important for oda kontris to keep dat one for mind.
Italy, for example, dey reduce dia 7-week lockdown but restaurants and bars dey open only for take-away.
Even as parks don reopen, social distancing rules still full ground remain.
As dia coronavirus commissioner, Domenico Arcuri tok, "Di virus still dey among us, e no strong like before but e still dey."
Dis na as plenti kontris dey look into mass testing as way to avoid second wave.
How to restart di economy One of di major reasons to comot lockdown na to reduce di impact wey di pandemic don get on di economy.
From small businesses to even multi-nationals sef, many businesses dem don suffer for di pandemic hand.
Di International Monetary Fund (IMF) dey expect di world economy go fall by 3% even as dem bin dey expect 6% growth before di pandemic start.
Di International Labour Organization (ILO) say work no sure again for about 1.6 billion workers on top say 430 million businesses dey in big trouble.
Na why plenti goments for world get stimuli packages for workers and companies.
But e go work?
E neva still clear.
Di IMF director of Research Gita Gopinath tink say di economy of di world go lose US$9 trilliom and dat na for di best case scenario.
To go back work Pressure don dey goment neck to reduce restrictions so pipo go fit work.
Bangladesh na kontri wey lobby work and dem dey start exit measures.
Factories for di textile industries don open plenti last week of April even as di lockdown still dey go on till di middle of May.
Bangladesh wey be di second largest explorer of clothes for world dem don dey suffer on top cancellation of orders from Europe and South America.
Rubana Huq, president of Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association say two million of dia workers fit lose dia jobs even with di fear of dia safety as dem dey work.
Belgium dey pressure dia workers on safety in fact, one of di busiest ports for di world, Antwerp dey test wristband wey go beep if pesin pass di 2 meter rule for social distancing for di workers.
Di wristband sef go help with contact tracing in case of infection and dem also dey test am for America.
But no be only factories and services suffer from Covid-19, agriculture dey hear dia own ween because of lack of labour.
Di whole supply chain from who dey farm, to di finisihed product don dey face palava, 'e.g India we don lose dia fist harvest of tea leaves cause no bodi dey to pick and go fit lose dia second harvest join and na why dem economies wey dey depend on crops dey press so dat food no go waste.
School closures na im almost evri kontri don adopt for dis pandemic.
By April 170 of di 193 kontris for UN don close down dia schools according to Unesco.
Na like 1.3 billion students don suffer because of di closures.
Some kontris don dey reopen and dey look for strategy to make sure say di students and staff dey safe.
Some dey reduce di number of pipo for class, UK dey only let year 10 and 12 come back as dem get exams soon, one Chinese school for Hangzhou dey give pikin cap so dem go maintain social distancing.
Dem dey do temperature check for Vietnam schools and different time for drop off and pick up of pikin for Norway schools.
Denmark dey make dia pikin dem to play for group wey no pass six.
While scientists dey fear say opening school fit make children dey share di virus, education sabi pipo say e dey good for dia education and mental health.
Pipo wey dey stay for wia dem plenti for dia fit spread coronavirus faster so di wahala now be say as dem lockdown dey end how dem go do normal life safely.
Many kontris no wan reduce lockdown restriction for restaurants, pubs and theatres, For Thailand, na cubicle pipo don dey eat inside as dem restaurants don dey get protective barriers and oda kontris don dey tink di same way.
For public transport wia social distancing go turn wahala, cities dem get oda plans.
Milan wia coronavirus finish work, go get new bike lanes to encourage biking for construction and factory workers.
Bogota sef wey be bike friendly city already dey build more bike lanes by di end of April.
For Paris, Mayor Anne Hildalgo get plan of 15 minutes city where you fit trek fifteen minutes to anytin you want for di city to avoid motor pollution wen France end dia national lockdown for 11 May.
Religious gatherings also chop cane from coronavirus hand and lockdowns.
Di pandemic don scata di calendars of plenti faiths.
E affect Christianity and Judaism for Easter and Passover, wey be some of dia biggest yearly celebration.
Even sef dem cancel di Buddist New Year for South Asia.
Dem go fit cancel di annual Hajj Pilgrimage for July in Saudi Arabia ontop dis same Covid-9.
But kontris dey wey dey try normalise di attendance for religious events.
Iran announce say dem go open mosques for parts of di kontri health authorities say dey free of coronavirus but say make dme do social distancing when dem go to pray.
Many religious groups don carry dia faith enter internet as dem dey stuck for house with streaming and sabi pipo tok say dis practice fit no end any time soon.
For Italy, goment no dey allow churches to reopen for now, and dat tin don dey vex clerics deem.
Reports wey say North Korean leader Kim Jong-un dey seriously sick afta im do heart surgery no dey true, according to officials for South Korea.
Headlines wey say Kim Jong-un dey "seriously sick", "brain-dead" or im dey "recover from operation" go always dey impossible to torchlight.
But di presidential office for Seoul don tok say no particular signs from di North to indicate say di 36-year-old dey "seriously sick".
Dis also no go be di first time rumour about im health go bring up plenty tok tok - only for dem to dismiss am later.
Kim Jong-un recently miss di celebration of im grandpapa birthday on 15 April.
Dis na one of di biggest events of di year, e dey mark di birth of di founder of di nation.
Kim Jong-un no ever don miss am - and very unlikely say e simply choose not to turn up.
As e be, im absence start di speculation and rumour, none of which dey easy to prove.
Kim Jong-un last appear for state media on 12 April as im "inspect pursuit assault plane group" for one handout wey no get date.
We know say im chair one key political meeting di day before, from state media despatches.
But dem never see am since.
State media also no make any mention of im presence for one missile test last week.
Im dey usually dey for dis kind launch dem.
Di claim about Kim Jong-un ill health surface for one website report on Tuesday wey one North Korean opposition dey run.
Anonymous source tell tori pipo Daily NK say Kim dey struggle with cardiovascular problems since last August "but e become worse afta many visits to Mount Paektu".
Dis come lead to many reports by international media ontop story wey get just one source.
News agencies come begin to run with dat claim, and na all dem bin get until some reports comot from intelligence agencies for South Korea and also show say di US too dey monitor di claim.
But later one sensational headline for US media comot say di North Korean leader dey in critical condition after heart surgery.
However, statement from South Korea goment, and sources for Chinese intelligence - for interview with Reuters news agency - say di tori no dey true.
E dey important to note say nobody don deny say Kim Jong-un undergo heart surgery.
Di statement from South Korea and China merely deny say di North Korean leader dey seriously sick.
For 2014, Kim Jong-un disappear for 40 days from early September - wey spark plenti speculation, wey include say oda political opposition don use coup comot am.
Den im re-appear for picture wia im hold cane.
State media dat time admit say im bin dey suffer from "uncomfortable physical condition", but dem no address rumours say im dey suffer from gout.
If anytin  happun to di North Korean leader, e no dey clear who go replace am.
Kim Jong-un papa prepare am to lead di kontri for many years.
Di Kim dynasty look secure.
Kim sister, Kim Yo-jong, look like di clear choice.
No be only say she come from di sacred "Paektu blood line", wey define di Kim dynasty, she done dey make more headlines of her own.
Last month she make her first public statement and she done dey make constant presence by her brother side for key summits.
But for now, we fit only watch and wait to see if North Korea react to dis many speculation about their leader health.
Di truth be say when e come to information about di North Korean leadership, many times we dey struggle to see road inside darkness.

Plenti report of domestic violence dey wey women too dey guilty of.
One out of three of evri woman and girl don experience physical and sexual violence for dia life, according to di UN.
E no dey common for man to tok about dia domestic violence palava.
Domestic violence against men na taboo for many societies, and di men wey be victims dey suffer dis palava alone.
One young man for Ukraine share im story wit di BBC, on condition say dem go keep im identity secret.
Na wetin im tell us be dis, plus some advice wey we collect from sabi pipo on how to recognise di signs of domestic abuse and wetin to do about am.
I no know if my friends suspect anytin.
Evritin look great from di outside: smiling faces, friends, plenti moni, happiness and confidence.
We dey travel half di world togeda.
I no dey fear wen we dey travel, she no go harm me wen pipo dey.
My fear na to avoid to dey alone for di same place wit her.
Na recently I sabi say my ex-wife dey rape me for 10 years.
Ira na my first woman.
We meet wen we dey our 20s - na she ask me out.
My parents tell me say I go need comot for house immediately I start to dey date anyone.
Dis one mean say, to start relationship mean say I go give up my family and house.
Inside one day, I lose evritin.
E dey make my liver cut.
I only fit afford relationship wen I bin don save plenty moni to live on my own.
On top of am, my mama dey shame for me sake of how I look- I bin get very low self-esteem.
Di first time wey I bin sleep with Ira back for dat time, I want am.
But, e no too dey normal.
E dey painful and aggressive.
Our first sex bin last for five hours and e pain me well well afta di kerewa.
She get dis craze wey be say she must to see sperm in di end.
She go rub me until I reach dia.
For average, e go last for one to two hours.
Pesin suppose enjoy kerewa but e no sweet me.
I no get experience and I bin dey think say na like dat e suppose be but I no dey give consent.
But e no too tey I sabi to say no be she no stop and na wen e come turn to rape.
I bin need to go overseas on long business trip.
I dey fear to lose Ira, so I ask am to follow me.
I even offer say I go marry her.
She refuse, but she join me las-las.
Na where e begin be dat.
I don dey overwork and I bin want rest, but she say she wan do kerewa.
I agree one time, two times… She go say, "I want am, I need am, so go give me.
I don dey wait for you for long time."
I go reply, "No, I no want to, I want rest, I don tired."
Den she go beat me and notin wey I fit do.
She go scratch my skin wit her fingernails till I start to dey bleed, she go punch me.
She no go leave any marks for my face - she go harm only place I fit cover: my chest, back, hands.
I no defend mysef becos I bin dey tink say to harm woman dey wrong.
Na how my parent raised me be dat.
I be dey feel small, weak and I no fit escape.
She go dey ontop of me.
I try rent anoda room for mysef for hotel once but I no dey speak dia language so dem no understand me for exception.
I come end up trapped.
I come dey fear to return to di hotel afta work, so I go dey waka about shopping mall until dem close.
Afta dat I go dey waka di town upandan.
E be season wey cold and wet and I no carry cloth for cold weather follow me.
So, I con get urinary tract infections, prostatitis, and fever.
Dis ones no even shake Ira: I need to dey do wetin she want.
Na weekend worse pass.
E go start from Saturday morning till Sunday night.
I don count wen we go leave Ukraine.
I tink say dat one go break our relationship but I dey wrong.
I go back my parents house and I no wan dey in touch with Ira or even to live with her.
But my try to comot for di relationship drag for years.
We go fight, I go turn off my phone and even block her for evriwia; I go hide but she go come siddon for door side.
She go call and promise say evritin go dey fine.
And I go go back to her evri time.
I dey fear to dey alone.
Wen e start, I bin wan leave am, then I late to give up.
I insist say we must marry, and we marry even tho I no want am again.
Ira dey jealous evrione: my friends, my family.
Wia eva I go, I need to always call her.
"Why I need attend those conferences?"
"Why need I meet friends?"
I go dey tell her.
She no fit go anywhere without me - I be play toy wey need to entertain her all di time.
Ira no get job - I provide for us, cook and even clean.
We get house wey get two bedroom but she no go gree me use di main bedroom, na di one wey guest dey use I bin give.
Every morning, I need wait till she wake up, na until wen she wake about nine or 10 o'clock or she go say I disturb her sleep.
She decide say we go dey sleep for different rooms and my room no get key.
I no even fit dey alone.
Wen I be do sometin wrong, she go shout for me and even beat me.
Na once a day dis kind tin dey happun or even evri oda day.
Anytin wey dey happun - she go blame me.
She go dey tell me di kind man wey she need, wetin he suppose do.
I dey powerless and I dey do evritin she want so she no go vex.
I remember as I go down di stair to go sit inside di car to cry.
She waka pass me and see me.
Wen I reach house, she say she dey sorry but she no fit stop.
So evritin go start again di next day.
No matta wetin I do or how bad e do me, nothing change.
I no dey perfect.
To dey avoid all dis, I use to work 10, 12, 14 hours every day, on weekends and even for holiday time.
E dey easy: some pipo dey drink - oda pipo dey choose to work.
Alyona Kryvuliak, head of the La Strada-Ukraine National Hotline Department, and Olena Kochemyrovska, adviser to the UN Population Fund on prevention and counteraction of gender-caused violence, name these and oda reasons.
Wen you dey inside a situation like dat, you no go realize wetin dey happun to you.
You no go see di way out and you no go hear wen you dey situation like dat, you no dey know wetin dey happun to you.
You no dey see di way out and you no dey hear from anyone.
You no even dey tink say you get time to escape, e just dey hopeless.
I dey tink wetin wey I no want do sake of say I don dey used to am.
I dey always owe somebodi sometin and I no even belong to mysef.
I belong to my grandmother, to my parents - I bin always dey tink say you need sacrifice evritin sake of relationship.
And so I sacrifice my interests and myself - e look normal to me back then.
So evritin get even worse.
In di beginning, I no just like am but later, like three to four years of do relationship, I bin dey get heart attack anytime she tok sex.
E go happun wen Ira find am and force me.
Wen I bin dey used to dey panic, I go push her away, hide, and run - run away from house, or from di room.
Ira think say we dey get sex problems becose of me so she dey carryime go sex doctor evri few years.

Olakunle Tejuoso stand for di middle of im record store, Di Jazzhole, im wear one turquoise modern 'buba' and 'sokoto' as im dey tok to staff wey dey rearrange books ontop shelves.
Im start to tink about tins wey im love to do during e childhood.
"Well, first of all I don dream of to own my own record store...
I dey always collect music wen I be small boy.
"I see am as natural way to go afta I leave school to continue di hobby of my childhood," na so Tejuoso tok.
Di Jazzhole, wey currently dey for Awolowo Road for Nigeria commercial capital, Lagos, first open business for 1991 for smaller space elsewhere in di city.
Nowadays, for time wen Afrobeats dey enjoy airplays for radio and for nightclubs, Di Jazzhole position imself as custodian of a different type of music.
As a result, di record and book shop na one of Lagos favourite hideaways to go back in time and enjoy old school records through contemporary ears.
"We open primarily to sell jazz and African music essentially, black music essentially with an emphasis on."
Vibrant jazz scene bin dey for 1990s, but e don now give way to oda types of music.
"[My customers] na men wey get money and CDs bin dey new den.
Dem bin no dey just buy, dem also understand di music becos dem don actually see a lot of di musicians.
"Dem don travel go abroad before and get enough money to go to festivals."
Tejuoso say dis days pipo get more appetite for jazz funk and smooth jazz.
"Di younger generation dey a bit different from wen we bin dey grow up."
Di Jazzhole na also di venue for live performances.
Tejuoso say di live events start as way to sell di music.
"You get to remember say we bin dey operate before internet come.
Dat time di only way to sell records na either you use radio or you find ways to draw pipo into di shop.
So you get show and den you sell di records and den you spread di word."
Di Jazzhole don welcome many performers wey include Asa, Brymo and most recently Nneka.
While Tejuoso tink about di memorable events of di 90s, im call e wife, wey be co-owner of di shop, to ask for her own.
"For me na still di [Fatai Rolling] Dollar days.
In terms of musicianship, na those old guys," na so she tok.
Tejuoso look back on wen one of di pioneers of highlife music, Fatai Rolling Dollar, share stage wit singer Keziah Jones.
"Just di interaction or di combination of someone from dat period [di 1950s] wit musicians from di 90s.
"I find am interesting and also di audience too, di fact say we dey work wit older generation musician and dey able to actually attract younger audience."
"Di Asa one I no go forget am.
I no go forget am becos many pipo bin dey dia, di shop bin dey bubble," na so im wife tok.
As di demand for music by African artists begin grow, Tejuoso see am as duty to not just be pesin wey dey keep music but also as producer.
Dis wan make am to start e own label for 1995.
"In di 90s, most of di stuff we bin dey get we dey import African music from Europe or somwia abroad.
"I just wake up one day and say at least we suppose get our own wey we dey produce and export too.
Dat na how we take start wit label."
Despite say di iazz scene now dey different and dey exist side by side with more popular types of music, Tejuoso believes say room dey for Jazz to do well for dis market.
"If jazz go get any future here, e go need to turn into our own language.
We go need rework am into our DNA in a way."
Artists and ogbonge pipo like Malian singer Salif Keita, Black Panther actors Lupita Nyong'o and Danai Gurira and King Mohammed VI of Morocco don visit di store.
Wit plenti books, CDs and vinyl records, di scent of coffee wey dem dey make and di sound of jazz for di background, Di Jazzhole don position imself as di spot for lovers of jazz.
"For me, jazz dey more serious wia pipo dey actually come to listen to di music and not smoke and drink over di music.
Jazz na different way of just receiving di vibe of music".

As Nigeria dey approach di end of di ease of lockdown, wetin many kontri pipo wan know na weda come 17 May goment go extend di lockdown ease, or go back to total lockdown.

But dis na before di president, Muhammadu Buhari decide to reduce di kontri one-month lockdown on 4 May.

Madam Abiola Akiyode-Afolabi, di oga of Women Advocates Research and Documentation Center (WARDC) say she no see how di goment fit resume total lockdown, because di economy of some places like Lagos, go suffer.
Although she blame di real cause of di palava on early preparation wey di Nigerian goment no do and how dem no involve pipo outside of goment to give dem ideas.
Since 4 May, di number of total cases for di kontri don jump from 2558 to 3526, mainly because of di community spreading wey don begin increase.
Nigerians don dey tok dia own on top social media as to weda we go need to implement anoda lockdown or not, mostly for Lagos state where dem get di highest cases.
Di kontri health minister, Dr E. Osagie Ehanire say one of di solution dey di hands of community, religious leaders and tori pipo because na dem go educate pipo say goment rules dey dia for dia own benefit.

Madam Abiola wey also train as lawyer bin worry say di Nigerian goment no provide way for kontri pipo to see all di assistance wey big-big organisations like EU and WHO dey give dem.
"For social media we bin see say UN dash money to di ministry of women affairs, but accountability no dey", Abiola bin tok.
"But for kontri like Canada, dem get website wey you fit go and see all di money wey dem dey spend and ontop wetin dem dey spend am".

E no tey one kind tori of how di bill no dey good for Nigerians, how di Assembly copy am from Singapore, begin spread for social media.

But BBC Pidgin don torchlight di mata, come find out di following facts.
"Tori of how di House of Reps. use rush to pass di bill "no dey true" Tok tok pesin for di House, Benjamin Kalu tell BBC.
Di bill "go need go through di different processes like any oda bill before dem approve am."
Oga Kalu say "Weda di bill don pass second reading or not, we never pass any bill as a lot of tins go need happun before we pass any bill".
"Di bill go need go through public hearing wia experts for di field go come and make dia contribution.
Afta dat, di bill go go through anoda committee wey dem go look evri clause for di bill wia members go agree on wetin dem want to dey inside and e go still go di senate wey fit do di whole process again or amend one or two tins."

On weda di Assembly copy di Bill from Singapore, oga Benjamin say dem no copy am.

As Nigeria president don announce say dem go begin to ease di lockdown for Lagos and Ogun states plus Abuja di kontri capital from today , May 4, to combat Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19), Lagos State Goment don tell all civil servants make dem no resume work immediately.
Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu, tok dis one for Sunday at di State House.
Im say di delay dey deliberate to prevent over crowding of pipo for roads and public places.
But if you dey go back work today or dey waka for public... 1.
Official work hours go be from 9am to 3pm.
2, Offices go dey operate at 60% capacity with infrared thermometer and tins to use do cleaning.
3, Commercial buses go dey operate for 60% capacity.

Goment go set up whistle blowers to monitor compliance, and if any whistle blower get info, make e send give goment numbers according to govnor Babajide Sanwo-Olu.
As pipo for Lagos State, southwest Nigeria and di kontri capital, Abuja, don dey commot small small sake of di relaxed lockdown, e be like say many don forget wetin social distancing mean.
Nigeria President Muhammadu Buhari announce say from today, 4th May, pipo for Lagos, Ogun and Abuja fit commot go do dia work between di time of 8am and 8pm.
Di goment say di measure dey neccessary to allow make pipo wey dey live on daily money to fit work and survive as world dey battle coronavirus.
But, as BBC pidgin go check streets today for Ojodu Berger, pipo just dey rush enter bus and no mind to observe social distancing, even di commercial buses wey dey carry pipo dey carry full load.
Lagos State goment tok say na only 60% capacity make public motor dey carry, so that pipo go fit observe social distancing.
Dis one mean say bus wey for carry 18 pipo no suppose carry pass 11 pipo.
For Ojodu Berger as BBC pidgin see, buses no mind dis social distancing rule.
In fact, pipo bin dey rush, dey push demsef to enter di buses.
Di Berger park of BRT bus, wey be di public transport owned by di goment, no encourage social distancing for pipo wey dey line up to enter di bus.
BBC pidgin see say di space wey dey between di passengers wey wan enter bus no reach di 2 meters wey health authorities advice for social distancing.
Although, as BBC pidgin observe, plenty pipo wey dey outside wear dia face masks-- many of which be di locally made one.
But, remember say sabi pipo for health don tok say to dey wear face mask alone no fit protect person from coronavirus.
Even Lagos goment for im rules and regulation tok say pipo must observe social distancing and continue to dey wash dia hands as dem dey wear di face mask.
For di Nigeria capital, Abuja, di workers for di state sef don pour enter street to find dia way to work.
BBC Pidgin tori person notice say for some suburbs like Nyanya-Mararaba wey be home to thousands of workers, security personnel block di road to monitor the flow of people from Nasarawa state, wey be anoda northern state, into the city.
Di security pipo dey prevent those wey no wear face masks.
Di security bin dey check motorcycle riders and pipo wey dey road with dia inferel thermometer before dem allow dem pass.
Dis morning for Nyanya-Mararaba, BBC tori person see as di security officers dey send some motors wey no obey di rules well back.
But like Lagos, social distancing sef bi problem.
As pipo and motorcycle riders dey queue so dat dem go check dem, dem no observe social distance.
Everybody line up back-to-back with no space between dem.
One Abuja person wey follow BBC tori pipo tok say na opportunity for dem to catch small fresh air.
Na wetin we don see so far be dis, we go dey update you as BBC pidgin tori pipo waka go oda places for Lagos, Ogun and Abuja.
As Nigeria federal goment don begin reduce lockdown starting from 4 May, e dey important to remember say coronavirus still dey town therefore e go fine to sabi some tins on how you go take survive dis relaxed lockdown.
First of all one of di tins to always cari for mind na di new guidelines wey goment don order to help reduce di spread of di virus.
Dem include: Beginning from May 4, pipo for Lagos and Ogun state plus Abuja go get curfew wey go start 8 for evening end 6 di next morning.
8pm to 6am curfew mean say: E dey compulsory to wear facemask once you dey for public.
If you no get moni to buy facemask, no wahala.
You fit take Ankara sow one for yourself.
Di idea of wearing facemask na to protect yourself, yor family and odas.
Remember say e fit no show for pesin face say im get coronavirus, dat na why social distancing na one of di easiest way to protect ya sef from catching coronavirus.
Anywia you dey, weda na for bus, for bus stop, for office o, make sure say you maintain at least 2 metres between you and di next pesin.
No fighting for bus like some pipo dey like do.
Life na jeje.
Any group wey pass twenty pipo avoid am like bullet.
If you dey follow public transport, shine your eyes.
Some states don already give number of pipo wey suppose sidon inside buses and taxi.
Find out wetin you state goment don order on top dis mata and make sure you obey.
If motor don reach how many wey goment tok, no go squeeze yourself join.
If you dey use car riding app like Uber and Bolt,, make sure say di driver no use AC so you no go inhale di virus.
No rob your hand for your face!
Make sure say you dey wash your hands as many times as possible.
If e no dey possible to wash your hand, use hand sanitizer wey getr plenty alcohol inside.
If dat tin no dey extra important sidon for your house.
Dis no be time to go greet pipo for dia house, shop or office.

Di coronavirus don affect businesses and economies.
Some sabi pipo say e go take months afta di virus palava end for anybody to fit gauge how bad e shake di world.
Officials for Nigeria say di kontri dey for di stage where COVID- 19 dey spread for community.
But wetin be community spread, and dem fit stop am?
Community spread mean say someone wey dey infected but health officials no dey sure as to where or how e take catch di virus.
When di outbreak bin first start, pipo wey dey at risk of di infection na dos wey just travel come from areas wey dey affected.
Di first cases wey dey that time, na from pipo wey go Wuhan China, where di outbreak first start.
But as di disease continue to dey spread for di world, pipo begin catch am afta dem travel to places like Italy, Kentucky and California.
Community spread begin dey popular since late February, wen one pesin wey no get any recent travel history test positive for di virus for California.
For Texas, dem report di first case of community spread for 11 March afta one Houston man wey no get any  travel history or near anyone wey fit don dey exposed to di virus test positive.
City officials and health experts don take serious actions like closing of schools and businesses because di virus go dey very hard to control once e begin spread from one pesin to anoda for inside community.
Health experts say na through social distancing, when you no go where plenty pipo gada, no near anybody and make di distance between you and anoda pesin no too dey close, na wetin fit stop or slow community spread.
Di idea of social distancing (dey your lane) don make many pipo begin work from house for dia companies, many kontris don cancel events wey fit make plenty pipo gada and plenty sporting events don cancel.
Dr. John Carlo, former Dallas County medical director and CEO of Prism Health North Texas, say social distancing wey come in a way, wey go make many events cancel, na  di first sure way to take control di outbreak.
Health experts say other things wey pipo fit do na to wash hand always, cover your mouth with toilet rolls or your elbow when you cough and sneeze and dey always clean things for house and when you touch anywhere, all na ways community spread fit stop.
E be like say we no dey get pipo wey sick well-well maybe because of di lockdown and maybe because those wey weak pass - old pipo for example no dey exposed (as part of di lockdown) and because most of our population dey young.
Half of us dey under di age of 18, e pipo like say di tin no dey hold dem like that.
Na wetin Dr. Orode O. Doherty, di Medical Director for Ingress Health Partners tell BBC Pidgin Di only real way to stop to dey infect others whether inside community or any other place na for pipo to avoid each other.
Di virus no fit live outside of our body… di only way e dey spread na when one pesin give anoda pesin.
Doherty add.
Dis no dey possible because e go mean say di serious lockdown wey we don see dey cause hunger and insecurity.
So we need to change di way we dey behave to allow us do social distancing but at di same time e no go stop important areas of di economy to kontinu to dey work until di spreading reach zero, or we get vaccine for am, di Medical Director for Ingress Health Partners tell BBC Pidgin She say In di meantime we need to increase our testing and find those wey fit don get di virus.
Dis go allow us to maintain our economy - as we dey do social distancing, give protection to old and pipo wey no well, reduce how we dey gada for public, to dey wear masks, not to stop washing of hands, and to give support to di poor and those wey need treatment.
On top dis one make we no forget we get medical workers wey dey face di virus both for public and private sectors, wey if dem no get Personal Protective Equipment, e go cause dem serious gbege and take us back.
Also put am for mind say if di economy drop to zero, too many people go die of hunger- young pipo wey we no fit afford to lose.
Pipo need to work and pipo need to farm and make food etc.
So now Nigeria dey deal with plenty poverty,  different different community wey no gel, public health system wey don kpafuka, and how di economy dey depend on importation to produce wetin we even need to take face di palava well well and package oursef.
Like many private sector providers for Lagos we don dey allow pipo to use phone to get medical advice, to educate our patient, to make sure we dey use social media to reach di general public and to make sure say we support for pipo wey get specific need.
We dey collaborate with private providers for Lagos, to support di work wey private practitioners dey do.
Also, we don dey epp pipo wey dis tin fit affect easily, old pipo, pipo wey sick, pregnant women and women wey just born and pikin wey get need medical attention.
We dey do dis through social media like Twitter, Instagram and WhatsApp.

Di World Health Organisation bin don warn say pipo wey get health complications dey at risk of di new coronavirus - meaning say dem dey more likely to die from di Covid-19 if dem catch di disease.

Unlike wetin local media dey report, di latest coronavirus cases in Nigeria on Saturday 25 April, 2020 no plenti for Kano, north west region of di kontri.
Tori be say local media bin dey report say Kano govnor bin don announce 74 new cases of Covid-19 on Saturday, but inside di latest case wey BBC Pidgin obtain from Nigeria Centre for Disease Control, NCDC, na just four new cases dey Kano as at dat day.
Lagos State, southwest Nigeria, na di epic centre for coronavirus inside di sub-Saharan nation wey get ova 200 million population and according to di centre for disease control (NCDC), more than half of di recorded cases for di kontri as of Tuesday evening dey Lagos State.
Some weeks ago, di Lagos State Commissioner for Health, Akin Abayomi, say community transfusion of Covid-19 don bi 80% of di total confam cases for di state.
"Dem be more local transmission going on as importation of cases don dey decrease," Abayomi tok during one press briefing.
On April 18, di state record three deaths, two inside be men wey no get travel history.
In response to di number of community cases wey dey increase, di state on Tuesday, announce say dem dey open twenty sampling centres for all di Local Government Areas wey dey di state to increase numbers of pipo dem dey test for di disease.
BBC Pidgin visit some centres wey dey Ikeja, Oshodi-Isolo and Agege and discover say dia preparedness level dey different.
Di centre for Agege don begin to dey collect sample, but di one for Ikeja just dey prepare and di one for Oshodi-Isolo never even start anything.
"We hear di the informate too but we never see anyone," na so one of di medical officers wey dey 1 Ajibulu, Mafoluku Oshodi, di place where di sampling centre suppose dey tell BBC pidgin.
Di Medical Officer of Health (MOH) for di Ikeja makeshift facility tell BBC say, sampling go commence fully tomorrow.
"We train di officials wey go work today," di MOH wey no gree give her name tell BBC.
Di sampling centre for Agege be di most ready for di tasks but di capacity low.
As of Monday, di centre don only collect nine samples.
Akintayo hopes say di number go increase as di medical supervisors begin dey used to dia new role.
"As dem continue to dey do am, dey go get better and faster," he tok.
Di centre dey open at 8am but close wen di laboratorian don tire.
"Di Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) na heat chamber and e dey very, very hot," Akintayo explain.
Covid-19 dey transmissible through droplets wey infected person release.
Experts say di virus fit stay active ontop surfaces wey di droplets land for days.
Security officers dey di entrance di premises to separate the Covid-19 potential patients from di oda patients wey dey visit di hospital for other healthcare services.
"DI route for those wey come for medical activities dey different from those wey come here for sample taking appointment," Akintayo tell BBC pidgin correspondent as im show her di path dem create with di red and white tape.
Security officers dey di path to ensure say pipo no pass where dem no suppose pass.
"Security men stay along di barricade to ensure pipo follow di right route," he tok.
Once visitors for di Covid-19 test do dey dey identify, dey go give dem face mask immediately, according to Akintayo.
Di sampling centre dey divided into sections wey go help dem easy to coordinate and help dem reduce crowd for ne place too.
Di first point na where dem dey find appointment forms of di patents and give dem unique code to take protect dia identity.
Dem dey fill di case   investigation form for dis place too, Di form dey for both digitally and manually.
DI sampling centres no dey attend to walk-in patients.
Patient suppose don book appointment before through di call centre.
When dem get di unique code dem go direct di patients to another section wia dem go take dia sample one by one.
Di white plastic chairs dey adequate space to make sure for social distancing.
Akintayo said dem no dey allow pass five or six person for di waiting area where dem go collect sample.
Den one by one, dem go dey call di patients from where dem stay to dey come do test.
"After dem don take di sample, di patient go comot through back of di building.
Dem no go fit come back to di area again.
We dey tell dem make dem no remove dia mask until dem reach house, di reason for dis na sake of say dem fit dey sneeze after di test.
Di face mask go protect odas wey dey close to dem.
We dey teach dem on how do throwey di mask too.." Back for inside di centre, dem go carry sample wey dem don collect go one of di four testing centres wey dey Lagos.. Di patients go get get dia result in three working days.
Testing time dey different.
E dey range from days to few hours.
For Australia, results sometimes dey take up to four days before di patients go know dia status.
But, for UK, di officials bin dey target to dey comot results within 24 hours  so dat patients fit dey releive say dem no get covid-19 or dem go quick start treatment.
"Environmental officer dey manage di waste we generate from di centre.
We dey also decontaminate di environment before and after di procedure every day."
Dis tori na as we take eye see am on Monday April 20, 2020
Afta di death of di chief of staff to Nigeria President Abba Kyari, di focus now na ontop who go replace am.
Oga Kyari die from Coronavirus last Friday for one Lagos hospital and dem bury am for Abuja di next morning.
E be one of di very few powerful pesin wey also get level among all di pipo wey dey work with President Muhammadu Buhari.
And so, many pipo dey feel whoever take ova im office go inherit am togeda with di power and levels wey late oga Kyari enjoy.
One political analyst Dr Abubakar Kari of University of Abuja tok say so far, many Buhari close associates dey ground wey im feel say fit be replacement for oga Kyari.
"I think Buhari fit pick either Ambassador Babagana Kingibe, Nigeria Custom Chief Rtd Conel Hameed Ali or Minister of Education Malam Adamu Adamu as im new Chief of Staff, " Dr Kari add.
Oga Kingibe and late Kyari na both from Borno state and oga Kingibe don bin dey ogbone offices before.
Kingibe also get good close relationship with di president currently, according to Dr Kari.
Equally di analyst tok say Malam Adamu and Colonel Ali also don enjoy di same, if not much closer relationship with Buhari.
"So e no go come as surprise, if Buhari decide to pick from di two," e add.
According to Dr Kari, di office of chief of staff to di president na very important one, but you no fit compare am with di office of state governor.
"And so, na opposite to wetin some pipo dey tink, e go dey very difficult to justify Kaduna State Governor Nasir el-Rufai as possible replacement to late Abba Kyari," e tok.
Some also tink say, President Buhari fit by imsef pick im former Minister of Interior AbdurRahman Dambazau because according to dem, e don dey eye di office for years.
But Dr Kyari tok say, considering di fact say Buhari no re-appoint am as minister for 2019, "I think Mr Dambazau too dey out of di race."
Wen we contact APC National Welfare Officer Alhaji Ibrahim Masari, e tok say e go dey too early to start to dey tok about issues like dat.
"Since no be elected position and vote dey involve, therefore we need to dey patient and wait for di President to pass through dis grieving period."
"Den later, e fit tok di right pesin wey go occupy dis ogbonge office," Masari tok.
Since afta di re-election of Buhari for 2019, Kingibe don build good relationship with di current goment especially because e come from di same state of Borno as Abba Kyari.
Even though di role wey im play for di past goment because former President Umaru Yar'Adua dismiss Kingibe as SGF afta Yar'Adu's return from medical vacation, fit affect am.
And di incidents follow di cancelling of MKO Abiola election for 1993, Kingibe na di running mate of Abiola but di Head of State dat time, General Sani Abacha later appoint am as minister of interior.
For the above reasons, some especially from South-West region of di kontri fit no dey comfortable with am.
But Kingibe get di know-how and experience of public service.
Na im be di custom oga for Nigeria.
Rtd Colonel Ali don dey work with President Buhari since dia military days.
Many pipo dey see am as one of di few pipo Buhari put for position of trust.
Colonel Ali close associate always dey give testimony of di way im no dey corrupt at all and e dey always follow due process.
If President Buhari pick am, di decision fit no go down well with politicians because e be di no fear or favour type.
E be di minister of education since di beginning of Buhari goment for 2015.
E work with Buhari for plenti years and e be one of di few associates wey fit work straight to see im oga for di Presidential Villa.
Before im ministerial appointment, Malam Adamu na ogbonge writer.
E dey always dey express im opinion concerning national and international issues.
Di Kaduna State Governor Nasir el-Rufai dey presently suffer from Coronavirus - di  same disease wey kill Abba Kyari.
Reports fly upandan say di governor don bin lobby to get di office last year, but no strong evidence to support dis report.
Since afta Buhari form CPC, el-Rufai come be im close political ally and e get very big influence for Nigeria goment.
If president Buhari pick am as some analyst dey suggest, e go be opportunity for am to make im presidential ambition for 2023 come true- dat na afta Buhari don complete im time for office.
Even though some pipo dey see am as very controversial and dis fit affect im chance.
Eighty-six new cases of coronavirus na im Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), confam on Sunday night to take di total number for di kontri to 627.
According to to NCDC, out of di 86 new cases, Lagos get 70 case, FCT record seven, den three na from Katsina , while Akwa Ibom get three, den Jigawa, Bauchi and Borno record one-one case each.
Dis latest figures cause reaction for di kontri.
Lagos state na currently di center of di outbreak for di kontri with 376 cases as at di 19th of April, 2020 One of di reasons na say Lagos state get testing capacity pass oda states and dem plan to do more.
Recently, Lagos state goment set up sampling collections stations for di 20 local goment areas inside di state wia citizens wey suspect say dem get any symptom of Covid-19 fit visit to drop samples for testing.
Health commissioner for di state, Prof. Akin Abayomi do press briefing on Sunday wia im tok say dis strategy na to bring Covid-19 testing opportunity closer to di pipo.
"Di idea na also to help reduce di work stress of health workers wey dey visit different local government to search for new cases and sample collection."
"Di new arrangement go provide opportunity for pipo for di local goment with symptoms of Covid-19 to present demsef early for testing."
oga Abayomi tok.
"We don decentralise di locations wia you fit submit yoursef for sampling.
So wetin we do na to move sampling stations to di local goment.
And if you feel say you get any of di symptoms wey dey like Covid-19, you fit present yoursef to dis decentralized sampling stations."
Abayomi tok.
Before di lockdown, plenti businesses, entertainment, events na im dey happun for inside Lagos state every day by day.
Lagos State na di smallest state for Nigeria yet, e get di highest urban population, wey be 27.4 % of di national estimate according to UN-Habitat.
According to di 2006 National Census, Lagos State get population of 9,013,534  But for 2015, di UN-Habitat and international development agencies' estimate say Lagos State get about 24.6 million inhabitants.
Di state get international airport wey be di busiest for di kontri.
Before di lockdown, travellers from China, US, UK, Canada and oda kontries from Europe and around di world dey land for di state on a daily basis plus ships wey also dey dock for di port.
Lagos state currently dey on a lockdown wey don enta di third week now -  Di kontri President Muhammadu Buhari extend di initial two weeks total lockdown by anoda two weks.
Some residents don hala say pipo no dey obey di lockdown rule.
Odas don criticise goment say dem adopt restriction wey no make sense based on di reality wey dey ground - say large percentage of pipo dey earn dia living based on every day hustle.
But if di numbers continue to dey increase, e no clear wetin di next step, something wey don already dey make pipo worry.

Na President tok-tok pesin, Garba Shehu announce dis one for statement and say dem go announce im burial arrangement soon.
E tok say Abba Kyari bin test positive for Covid-19 and bin dey already receive treatment before im die.
Kyari na di first senior government official to die of COVID-19 for Nigeria and im na Presido Buhari confidant and one of di most prominent persons for goment.
Di office of di Chief of Staff to di President no get any backing of di constitution.
But di office na one wey many politicians dey even lobby to get.
Since Nigeria 20 years of  democracy, di position of chief of staff don be office wey many dey envy for di kontri.
Dis na sake of say di office dey play two major role of politics and bureaucracy.
Since 1999, Nigeria don get five Chiefs of staff and dem be Maj-Gen Abdullahi Mohammed(rtd), Chief Gbolade Osinowo, Chief Mike Oghiadomhe, Brig-Gen Jones Arogbofa(rtd), and Mallam Abba Kyari.

Di Chief of staff power come even increase wen presido ask all im cabinet members to check wit am and di SGF before dem meet am.
Im position don also cause plenti drama wit di wife of di president, Aisha Buhari wey accuse say some cabals don high jack im husband.

One preaching by Nigerian pastor, Chris Oyakhilome, wey im capture for video circulate for social media afta e go viral.
Pipo share di video of Pastor Chris wey dey tok about 5G and di end time.
One Twitter handle share one part of di preaching and on top dat handle alone, di video don gather more dan 100,000 views.
Di Bible tori wey Oyakhilome tok about for di video.
Di user of di account sef believe say di vaccine na sign of di end time.
BBC Pidgin try to collect di full video for pastor Oyakhilome church website and YouTube but dem don delete am.
But for part of di video wey still dey circulate, di pastor claim say na di 5G network dey make pipo sick and no be coronavirus.
BBC Pidgin tok to sabi pipo wey tok say im yan na lie.
Abdulrahman Odunaye, Network solution Architect wey dey live and work for di Middle East, explain give BBC Pidgin say 5G no get connection with di coronavirus pandemic.
"No correlation between 5G and coronavirus.
If we even wan go into science of di whole thing, even if electro-magnetic waves go harm you, e no go metamorphose into virus.
If to say coronavirus dey show like cancer, e fit get scientific backing because some pipo for science dey believe say electro-magnetic waves dey cause cancer," na how Odunaye take chook mouth for di tori wey di pastor bin give.
One doctor wey go Havard University and currently base for US, Joshua Adeoye, explain further for anoda interview with BBC pidgin say viruses dey behave different from cancer for bodi.
"Viruses bi organisms, like bacteria.
So when dem enter bodi, dem dey always look to take over dia host cell system, so dey fit use dat system , replicate demsef, Adeoye tok.
"Cancer for di oda hand, be deranged growth.
Abnormal cells wey suppose die but continue to dey happun at abnormal and uncontrolled rate.
"While virus fit take over di cell apparatus to create imsef (so di cell no go fit replicate imsef), di cancer cell dey replicate on im own.
Na so Adeoye conclude.
Oyakhilome for di video also claim say di reason Nigerian goment, like oda goment for di world, lock down Abuja and Lagos na to enable dem install di 5G cables.
First, di Federal Ministry of Communication and Digital Economy don tok say Nigeria no get di new wireless technology.
Sabi pesin Odunaye sef  tok say im be part of di team wey one lead telecommunication company for Africa to gather to try implement 5G network.
Di use of 5G dey limited for Africa.
According to one DW report, 5G dey commercially available for Lesotho and South Africa but di use dey limited.
Even though some African kontris don do demos, Odunaye say di application of di network no dey anywhere for west Africa.
Even though Lesotho get some presence of 5G, no single case of coronavirus dey di kontri as at di time Oyakhilome tok im tok, and no case even at di time wey we write dis report.
Odunaye say: "If di 5G dey directly related to di coronavirus, then I fit say make Nigeria no worry about coronavirus because 5G no dey Nigeria.
Na only one network don run test for 5G for Nigeria and right now dem don stop as dem hit major road block."
Oyakhilome also tok say to dey stay for house no dey scientific and e no go protect person on top dis virus.
He come laugh di instruction wey everybody for di world dey observe as one measure to take stop di spread of di virus.
"Why we dey stay inside house," he ask. "
Shey di virus dey fly pass, so we dey wait am make e pass?
Why we dey inside?
Scientifically, dis na di most foolish tin I don see.
No science dey for dis.
E dey stupid.
"Oyakhilome tok.
Di World Health Organisation advise say social distancing na di way to reduce di spread of coronavirus wey dey  spread through droplets.
Di pastor, also tok about how di 5G network and Covid-19 be plan to ensure say everyone for di world dey vaccinated, wey go allow everyone get "digital identity".
Oyakhilome even use one article for one website 'Biometric Update' for September 30, 2019.
Oyakhilome interprete di title of di article to mean say digital identity na number inside human bodi.
"E be number for your bodi.
E dey on you.
E go be on you," im tok.
Di website don sharpaly re-write di article plus including definition of digital identity as dem see say some pipo dey misunderstand dia article, BBC Pidgin speak with di editor of di website wey explain why dem include di definition for digital identity.
"We update di post in question after we become aware say e dey cause misunderstanding or otherwise some of our readers dey misinterprete,".
Sabi pesin Odunaye add say "digital identity" no be tracker for body but instead "e be representation of things for internet."
Di madam wey dey incharge moni mata for Nigeria say e dey true say Nigeria no dey part of di kontris wey benefit from IMF debt relief for di poorest and most vulnerable members for di next six months sake of coronavirus.

Health boss say deh de first two cases test negative and deh don go back for house even if deh di still monitor dem.
Cameroon don set up place for check de passengers for multi-purpose sports complex.
But most of all, make kontri pipo respect hygiene rules, wash hands wit soap, no touch nose eyes, no shake hands… If deh get catarrh, fever, headache, no di breath fain make deh call 1510 and deh go take care.

Yesterday Cameroon take some 13 strong measures for reduce spread-close border, schools, stop visas, gadaring for more dan 50 pipo and plenti odas.
But, some kontri pipo say goment too late, as deh for act fast wen de first case start.

Just now, de new cases weh deh get de disease dey for different parts of Cameroon, two for Bafoussam, one for Garoua.

Coronavirus outbreak alias COVID-19 disease wey dey affect more and more kontries around di world don make some pipo dey give different heath advise online as e be say di disease neva get any cure.
We wan torchlight some of di popular myths or fake claims wey pipo don share online about wetin fit cure di virus and explain wetin science tok concerning di claim.
Plenti posts for facebook advice pipo say make dem dey chop garlic to prevent infection.
World Health Organization (WHO) tok say while garlic na "healthy food wey fit get some antimicrobial properties", e no get any evidence or proof wey show say if pesin chop am, e fit protect dem from di new coronavirus.
Also too much garlic fit sometimes cause harm to pesin bodi, for example, South China Morning Post report one tori of one woman wey dem rush go hospital for treatment sake of say her throat swell up afta she chop 1.5kg of raw garlic.
We know, in general, say eating fruit and vegetables and drinking water dey good for staying healthy.
But no evidence don show say some kian food fit help fight dis particular virus.
Plenti advise don full social media wey say heat dey kill coronavirus, and so make pipo dey drink hot water, take hot baths, or use hairdryers.
One fake post wey no truly come from Unicef but wey plenti pipo from different kontries copy and paste - claim say drinking hot water and exposure to sun go kill di virus, plus make pipo avoid ice cream  Charlotte Gornitzka, wey dey for Unicef on coronavirus misinformation, tok say:  "Dat recent lie-lie online message... wey pipo claim say na Unicef post am, wey dey advise pipo to avoid ice cream and oda cold foods to help prevent di disease.
no be true at all, na big lie."
We know say di flu virus no dey survive well outside di body during hot weather, but we neva get evidence wey prove how heat dey affect di new coronavirus.
Gornitzka, tok One sabi pesin, Professor Sally Bloomfield say Trying to heat your body or expose yoursef to di sun -  to prevent di virus - no dey work at all.
Once di virus dey your body, e no get any way wey you fit take kill am- your body just need to fight am off.
Outside di body, "to actively kill di virus you need temperatures of around 60 degrees", and dis dey far hotter than any bath or sauna.
Professor Bloomfield tok.
Washing bed linen or towels at 60 degrees na good idea, as dis fit kill any virus for di material.
But no be good option for washing your skin.
And bathing hot water or drinking hot liquids no go change your actual body temperature, wey remain stable unless you already dey sick.
One post, wey plenti pipo for Facebook copy and paste quote one "Japanese doctor" wey recommend say make pipo dey drink water every 15 minutes to flush out any virus wey fit don enta di mouth.
One version of dis post inside Arabic language don get more than 250,000 shares.
Professor Bloomfield tok say no evidence don show say drinking water every 15 minutes go help.
Airborne virus dey enta di body through di respiratory tract wen you breathe in.
Some of dem fit  go inside your mouth, and even drinking water no go prevent you from catching di virus.
Anyway shall, drinking water and to stay hydrated na generally good medical advice.
One YouTube pesin, Jordan Sather, wey get thousands of followers, claim say "miracle mineral supplement", wey dem dey call MMS, fit "wipe out" coronavirus.

Di FDA say  "dem no know of any research wey show say dis products dey safe or fit treat any illness".
Dem sama warning say drinking dis substance fit cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and symptoms of serious dehyrdation.

Pipo wey support colloidal silver treatment idea dey claim say e fit treat all kind of health conditions, act as antiseptic, and help di immune system.
But US health authorities don give clear advice say no evidence don show say dis type of silver fit cure any health condition.
Dem add say colloidal silver fit even cause serious side effect including kidney damage, seizures and argyria - dat na condition wey dey make pesin skin to turn blue.
Di post of some of di pipo wey dey promote di use of colloidal silver inside social media don get one pop-up warning from Facebook fact-checking service.
Health authorities say dis colloidal silver no dey like iron or zinc, no be metal wey get any function for di human body.

One of those wey support dis claim be National Democratic Congress, Communications Director, Sammy Gyamfi who argue say coronavirus help de cedi appreciate sake trade volumes between Ghana den China reduce.
Therefore importers shun dey go buy goods from China sake of de deadly virus.
De result be say menerz dey dema dollars for de country inside, reducing de pressure on de cedi.

"Ghana exposure in terms of trade volumes to China be high but other African countries like Nigeria, South Africa, Zambia, the Ghana no be unique."
From that perspective you no fit attribute de appreciation of de cedi to de Ghana cedi.
According to Professor Bokpin, "if you check de data, de appreciation of de Ghana cedi start before de announcement of coronavirus.
De cedi recovery start before dem declare an global health issue."
"What dey happen be Bank of Ghana en strategic intervention.
Central Bank sheda build dema reserves so say of Ghana sheda shore up dema reserves in preparation for 2020" he add.

Tony Iwobi beams as im stand next to pishure of Giuseppe Garibaldi for di Senate building for Rome.
Like di 19th Century general, wey help find modern Italy, pipo don call oga Iwobi "history maker".
Im be Italy first and only black senator.
Iwobi confess say im feel "like pikin on di first day for school" when im take e seat alongside di other 320 senators.
Im say im get duty, not only to his Italian constituents, but also to di continent wia dem born and raise am: "Anytin I do today, I no dey do am for myself, but for di nation I represent and for di African black race!"
Dem elect am last year as part of support for right-wing Lega (League) party, wey form year-long coalition wit the populist Five Star Movement.
Now out of power, di League na still Italy most popular party with 33% for di latest polls.
Dem dey popular for dia tough stance on migration.
Critics say dem dey use Iwobi wey be di party immigration spokesman as cover for dia "racist views".
Dem point to one incident for 2013 when one Lega senator refer to Italy first black minister, Cecile Kyenge, as "orang-utan".
Mr Iwobi admit his colleague bin dey "wrong" but reject di allegation wey say di party dey use am: "Make dem go search my story," im tok.
"Nobody dey use me.
I tink wit my own brain."
Di Nigerian immigrant arrive Italy on student visa for 1977.
Im plan before na to return home afta im studies, but tins change afta im mit Italian woman, wey become im wife.
Iwobi join im party, den known as di Northern League, for 1993.
For 20 years im serve as local councillor for di northern province of Bergamo.
For im office, across di street from di Senate building, hangs a T-shirt wit di slogan "I stand wit Salvini" - a sign of im support for im party leader, Matteo Salvini.
Wen im bin dey goment, Mr Salvini famously turned away migrant boats, leaving hundreds stranded for di Mediterranean Sea last summer.
But Mr Iwobi insists di League no be anti-immigration.
"We stand for legal migration.
Anybody wey come through di right channel legally dey highly welcomed.
We dey for refugees, but we dey against illegal immigration and death tunnel," na so Iwobi tok, as im dey refer to di thousands of immigrants wey don die as dem dey try to reach Europe.
"E dey against human dignity."
Like im party leader, Iwobi see di arrival of plenti African migrants, wey dey cross di desert and sea to land for Italy, as di result of failed migration policy.
His view dey shared by anoda black Italian, Paolo Diop.
Now 30, Diop land for Italy from Senegal wen e dey two years.
Diop na immigration spokesman for far-right party Fratelli d'Italia (Brothers of Italy), wey get roots for Italy old fascist movement.
"I be di son of immigrants wey arrive Italy legally at a time wen Italy economy bin dey grow.
Now no dey grow, so we no fit welcome economic migrants any longer."
Mr Diop say im neva experience discrimination, but for February 2018, for Macerata, di town wia im dey live, fellow right-wing activist Luca Traini shoot and wunjure six African migrants.
Mr Diop bin know Traini, wey currently dey serve 12-year jail term.
"We bin dey di same political circles.
Na good pesin im bin be.
I no ever get any problems wit am.
I no go ever want to inspire someone wey carry out such acts.
Diop say African migrants for Italy need to learn trade den go home and "make Africa great".
But so far di message no dey get through.
Musician Tommy Kuti believe right-politicians dey exploit scenes like this.
"Dem like that situation of chaos," im tok, "to scare Italian pipo and make am right for dem to push discriminatory laws."
Like Senator Iwobi, dem born Kuti for Nigeria - im move go Italy with im parents wen im small.
Now a successful rapper, im music explores identity and politics and dey criticise di League.
"I tink Toni Iwobi na something wey dey really work against migrants for Italy for time wen we need pipo to fight for us to get us more rights."
Kuti tink say white Italians believe "every black pesin na migrant".
For Angelica Pesarini, di roots of attitudes to race for Italy dey deep.
She dey teach course for Black Italia for New York University in Florence.
"Italy colonial past - especially di fascist regime - don always dey very connected to ideas of race and whiteness and dis still dey visible nowadays.
Becos to be Italian is to be white," she explains.
Though born in Italy, Dr Pesarini's family come from Eritrea and Somalia, connection wey go back to Italy colonial adventure for di Horn of Africa.
Pipo from Ethiopia, Somalia and Eritrea grow up learning Italian and absorbing di culture.
Those wey move go Italy shock to discover how little Italians know about dem.
And even today, many Italians dey ignorant about dia kontri colonial past, na so Dr Pesarini tok.
"I feel I gats to justify my Italian-ness a lot... People assume I no fit be Italian.
And so even wen pipo ask me: ''Wia you I come from?
I go say: 'from Rome'.
Den dem go ask: 'No, but wia I really come from?
I den realise how race and colonialism and whiteness dey connected to Italian identity today."
Activists want di goment to make am easier for second-generation immigrants, those born and raised in Italy, to claim Italian citizenship.
Dia biggest opponents na Paolo Diop Brothers of Italy and Senator Iwobi party, di League.
Mr Iwobi dismisses activists' concerns, as im claim say those wey dem den Italian citizenship no follow di regulations.
As for those illegal immigrants wey still dey live for Italy, Senator Iwobi want di goment to help dem gain new skills to allow for wetin im call "voluntary repatriation".
Rapper Tommy Kuti no agree wit di senator's ideas: "I tink if im want migrants to stay in Africa, make im set good example and take e ass back to Africa."
